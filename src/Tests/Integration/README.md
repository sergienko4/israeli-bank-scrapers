# Bank Integration Tests (Mode A — static HTML + Mode B — mirror origin)

Cross-bank integration coverage that fills the gap between unit tests
(mocked DOM) and live E2E (real credentials).

## What this layer guarantees

For every bank wired into the new **Pipeline** architecture
(`src/Scrapers/Pipeline/Banks/`), there is a committed static-HTML
fixture **plus** an integration test that drives the **real**
production `LoginFieldDiscovery` + `CreateElementMediator` chain
against that fixture.

If a future PR adds a pipeline bank without integration coverage, the
`bank-coverage` gate (husky pre-commit **and** CI Validate job) fails
the commit / PR with a clear remediation message.

## Two modes

| Mode                  | Source                                                                        | Use case                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A — static HTML**   | `fixtures/banks/<id>/<step>/main.html` loaded into a real Playwright page     | Fast, deterministic. Guards #307-class regressions inside the resolver chain.                   |
| **B — mirror origin** | Local route handler that **replays** the captured HTML at the bank's real URL | Exercises the production `page.goto(originUrl)` navigation chain without hitting the live bank. |

Both modes are wired into the gate and run sequentially after every
other test phase, immediately before the real-bank e2e happy path.
Onboarding a new pipeline bank requires fixtures + drive coverage in
**both** modes (the gate rejects half-coverage).

## How to add a new pipeline bank

1. Implement `Pipeline/Banks/<Name>/<Name>Pipeline.ts` and **export**
   `<NAME>_LOGIN: ILoginConfig`.
2. Add a row to `Banks/BankFixtureExpectations.ts` keyed by the
   canonical `bankId` (lower-first matching `CompanyTypes`).
3. Wire the bank into `BANK_LOGIN_CONFIGS` in
   `Banks/LoginFormDiscovery.integration.test.ts`.
4. Add a recipe to `Tools/HarvestBankHtml.ts`.
5. Harvest the fixture:

   ```
   npx tsx src/Tests/Integration/Tools/HarvestBankHtml.ts <bankId>
   ```

6. Verify the gate passes:

   ```
   npm run lint:bank-coverage
   ```

7. Run the integration tests:

   ```
   npm run test:integration:mode-a
   npm run test:integration:mode-b
   ```

## SPA banks (`requiresHydration: true`)

A few banks (Discount, Max, VisaCal, Mercantile, OtsarHahayal) render
the login form post-JS. The captured HTML alone is **not** sufficient
to drive `LoginFieldDiscovery`, so those expectation rows have
`requiresHydration: true` and the production-drive assertions are
skipped for them in both Mode A and Mode B. The harvested HTML still
gates the **structural** invariants (origin URL, page title, anchor
markup present in the shell) so we catch shell-level regressions.

Asset capture (CSS / JS / fonts) under `Mode B` is a follow-up so the
SPA banks can hydrate inside the mirror and DRIVE the full chain.

## The gate (pre-commit + CI)

`Tools/CheckBankIntegrationCoverage.ts` walks every pipeline-bank
directory under `src/Scrapers/Pipeline/Banks/` and verifies:

- The pipeline file exports `*_LOGIN: ILoginConfig`.
- `BankFixtureExpectations.ts` has a row for the corresponding
  `bankId`.
- `fixtures/banks/<bankId>/` exists.

Legacy non-pipeline banks (Leumi, Mizrahi, Yahav, Behatsdaa,
BeyahadBishvilha) and API-direct providers (OneZero, Pepper, PayBox)
are explicitly allow-listed and exempted from the gate.

Wiring:

- **Pre-commit**: `.husky/pre-commit` → `bg_gate "bank-coverage" yes npm run lint:bank-coverage`
- **CI Validate**: `.github/workflows/pr.yml` → `Bank integration coverage gate` step

## Why this layer exists

Two production regressions slipped past unit tests in 2026-06 because
both bugs only manifest under real DOM order:

- **#307** — Isracard 2-form lobby (OTP form vs password form) — fixed
  by scoping `LoginFieldDiscovery` to the discovered form anchor.
- **#309** — Discount accessibility skip-link with same visible text
  as the real login button — fixed by `filterOutSkipLinks` in
  `CreateElementMediator`.

The static-HTML integration tests reproduce these scenarios offline so
the next regression of the same shape is caught at PR time, not in
production.
